# ΛΞVON OS - Architecture Design Document
Document Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-07-03
Status: Canonized
Author: ARCHIVEX
Traceability: This document is the direct technical implementation of SRS-ΛΞVON-OS-v1.0.
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Architecture Design Document (ADD) provides a detailed, low-level design of the ΛΞVON OS V1.0 system. It expands upon the SRS by defining the precise API contracts, database schemas, and component interaction patterns. This document is the primary technical guide for the engineering team.
1.2 Scope
The scope covers the detailed design of all backend microservices, the frontend application structure, the complete database schema, and the security mechanisms governing their interaction.
2. System Architecture
2.1 Communication Patterns
The system employs two primary communication patterns:
Synchronous Request/Response: For most user-initiated actions, services communicate via synchronous RESTful API calls through the central API Gateway. This ensures immediate feedback to the user.
Asynchronous Event Streaming: For security monitoring and logging, services publish events to a message bus (e.g., Google Cloud Pub/Sub, or a managed DragonflyDB stream for V1). The aegis-service is the primary consumer of these events, allowing for decoupled, non-blocking security analysis.
2.2 API Gateway
The Next.js backend (acting as Backend-for-Frontend) serves as the API Gateway. It is the single entry point for all client requests. Its responsibilities are:
Authenticating incoming requests by validating the JWT.
Routing requests to the appropriate downstream microservice.
Aggregating responses from multiple services if required.
3. Detailed Service Designs
3.1 auth-service

6. Security Architecture
6.1 JWT Authentication Flow
Issuance: The auth-service issues a short-lived (15 min) JWT upon successful login. The JWT payload contains userId, email, and sovereigntyClass.
Client Storage: The JWT is stored in a secure, HttpOnly cookie on the client to prevent XSS attacks.
Validation: The API Gateway validates the JWT signature and expiration on every incoming request.
Downstream Propagation: The API Gateway forwards the validated JWT payload (as a simplified JSON header, not the full JWT) to the downstream microservices, which trust the gateway's validation. This prevents each service from needing to re-validate the signature.
This ADD provides the final layer of technical detail required for implementation. It is the definitive source for building ΛΞVON OS V1.0. Adherence to these specifications is mandatory.
