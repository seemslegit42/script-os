# ΛΞVON OS: Governance - Economic Audit Trails
1. Introduction: The Immutable Chronicle of Tribute
The Economic Audit Trails are the uncorruptible chronicle of every value exchange within ΛΞVON OS. As a system where every "Agent Action" is metered and monetized, and where user belief is cultivated through economic rituals, absolute auditability is paramount. This protocol ensures that every ΞCredit spent or gained, every Boon granted, and every Folly Instrument interaction is permanently recorded, providing the foundational data for trust, compliance, and the sophisticated operations of the KLEPSYDRA Engine.
2. Core Principles of Economic Auditability
Immutability: Once an economic event is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted.
Traceability: Every transaction can be traced from its origin to its conclusion, including all influencing factors.
Completeness: All relevant economic events are captured, leaving no gaps in the ledger.
Verifiability: The integrity and authenticity of audit records can be cryptographically proven.
Transparency (Internal & Controlled External): While user-facing narratives may mask complexity, the raw economic data is fully transparent to authorized administrators and auditable by external parties.
Aegis Compact: Aegis is the ultimate witness, signing and securing every entry.
3. Key Components of Economic Audit Trails
3.1. The Scroll (Aegis-Signed Log)
Description: A separate, append-only, immutable log that records the human-readable details of every transaction. This is the primary source for a complete, auditable history for both administrators and users (via the Treasury.MicroApp).
Integrity: Each entry is signed by Aegis, ensuring its authenticity and preventing any post-facto alteration. This cryptographic signature is a core part of the log entry.
Content of Entry:
transaction_id (UUID from Obelisk Pay's Vault)
user_id (UUID of the Initiate)
timestamp (TIMESTAMPTZ)
instrument_id (ID of the Folly Instrument or source of transaction)
tribute_amount (Decimal, if debit)
boon_amount (Decimal, if credit)
outcome_type (e.g., win, loss, pity_boon, profit_vent, purchase_credits, chaos_card_play, transmutation)
narrative_description (Human-readable summary, e.g., "Tribute to Sisyphus's Ascent," "Boon from the Oracle's Gyre," "Purchase of 500 ΞCredits," "Transmutation of $175 CAD via Proxy.Agent")
context_details (JSONB, optional: additional relevant data like Chaos Card ID, Vow Alignment Score, Syndicate ID).
aegis_signature (Cryptographic signature by Aegis).
3.2. The Vault (Obelisk Pay's Core Ledger)
Description: The dedicated, encrypted, high-performance PostgreSQL database that serves as the core ledger for all user balances (ΞCredits, Potential (Φ)) and atomic transaction records.
Integrity: Built on a double-entry accounting model, ensuring the system is always in perfect balance. Every credit to one account is a debit from another.
Auditability: While the Scroll provides human-readable logs, The Vault provides the raw, auditable financial data for reconciliation and deep analysis.
3.3. potential_accrual_log
Description: A specialized, immutable log within the KLEPSYDRA Engine that records the accrual of Potential (Φ).
Content: event_id, user_id, instrument_id, timestamp, luck_weight (from SRE), Φ_awarded, narrative_context.
Purpose: Crucial for temporal analytics, retroactive multipliers during "The Reckoning," and proving loyalty (Proof-of-Loyalty asset) [cite: previous user input].
3.4. System-Wide Telemetry & Metrics
Description: Beyond explicit transaction logs, comprehensive system telemetry (e.g., agent activity, workflow execution, UI interactions, PCE metrics) contributes to the overall audit trail and provides context for economic events.
Purpose: Supports Return on Belief (RoB) instrumentation, Vow Alignment Score (VAS) tracking, and Tribute Velocity Index (TVI) calculation.
4. Integration with Core Systems
Obelisk Pay: The primary source of atomic transaction data, which is then signed and logged by Aegis in The Scroll.
KLEPSYDRA Engine: Feeds data to the TributeLog and potential_accrual_log. It also consumes audit data for Profit Dials and Psyche-Calibration Engine adjustments.
Aegis: The central authority for signing and verifying the integrity of all economic audit trails. Aegis monitors these logs for anomalies and compliance violations.
Billing Service: Ensures that all Agent Actions debits are correctly logged and auditable.
Loom Studio (The Loom of Fates): Provides visualization of economic audit data (e.g., TributeLog entries, Φ accrual) and allows administrators to drill down into specific transactions for auditing and analysis.
The Pantheon: Displays high-level economic metrics (e.g., Tribute Velocity) for each user, derived from the audit trails.
5. Development Directives
Immutable Logging: All economic events MUST be logged to append-only, immutable storage. No updates or deletions are permitted on completed TributeLog or potential_accrual_log entries.
Aegis Signing: Implement the cryptographic signing mechanism by Aegis for all critical economic log entries.
Atomic Operations: Ensure all data writes related to economic transactions are atomic (e.g., using database transactions).
Traceability: Every economic event must include sufficient metadata to trace it back to the user, instrument, and time of origin.
Performance: Optimize logging mechanisms for high-frequency, low-latency recording of micro-transactions.
Exportability: Provide tools for authorized administrators to export audit trails in standard formats for external auditing.
Compliance: Ensure the audit trails meet the requirements of relevant financial and data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA for PHI-related transactions).
