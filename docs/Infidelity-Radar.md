# Spectre Intelligence Suite: The Infidelity Radar - Technical Specification

> "When suspicion becomes evidence, it gets a cover page."

## 1. System Overview

The Spectre Intelligence Suite, known colloquially as the "Infidelity Radar," is a **premium, multi-agent intelligence console** Micro-App. It provides a user with a powerful suite of OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), behavioral analysis, and social engineering tools to investigate a person of interest.

This is a high-value, high-stakes utility that demonstrates the full power of the ΛΞVON OS agentic swarm, orchestrating multiple specialized daemons to compile a comprehensive dossier.

## 2. Core Components & Implementation

### 2.1. The `burn-bridge-agent.ts` (Meta-Agent)
The suite's core logic is orchestrated by a `LangGraph` meta-agent called the "Burn Bridge Protocol." When invoked, it executes the following steps in parallel:
1.  **OSINT Scan**: Calls the `osint.ts` agent to scour public data breaches, social media, and other open sources for information on the target.
2.  **Behavioral Analysis**: Calls the `infidelity-analysis.ts` agent to analyze a user-provided description of the situation for psychological red flags.
3.  **Decoy Deployment**: Calls the `decoy.ts` agent to generate a context-aware "seduction" message designed to test the target's loyalty.

### 2.2. The `dossier-agent.ts`
Once the parallel scans are complete, the `burn-bridge-agent` passes all collected data to the `dossier-agent.ts`, which synthesizes the information into a single, cohesive, and professionally formatted intelligence report in Markdown.

### 2.3. The `infidelity-radar.tsx` Component
The UI is a tabbed interface that serves as the command-and-control center for the suite.
- **OSINT Tab**: Allows the user to input a target's name and context to run the OSINT scan. Displays the report when complete.
- **Analysis Tab**: Provides a textarea for the user to describe the situation for behavioral analysis. Displays the risk score and summary.
- **Decoy Tab**: Allows the user to configure and deploy the AI decoy agent.
- **Dossier Tab**: Displays the final, synthesized dossier and provides options to export it as a secure PDF or JSON file.
- **Burn Bridge Protocol**: A master button that triggers the entire multi-agent workflow at once.

## 3. Integration with ΛΞVON OS

- **Agent Swarm Demonstration**: This is the flagship example of a multi-agent swarm, where a meta-agent orchestrates several specialist daemons to achieve a complex goal.
- **Billing**: The "Burn Bridge" action is a high-cost `COMPLEX_LLM` operation with a multiplier, reflecting the significant computational resources it consumes. Individual scans are also billed as separate agent actions.
- **The Armory**: As a premium, high-affinity, and potentially controversial utility, the Spectre Intelligence Suite is available as a one-time purchase in The Armory.
